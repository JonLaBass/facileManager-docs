The custom URL resource record allows domains or records to redirect users to a web page. This is enabled by defining one or more web servers that will handle the web redirects at **_Admin â†’ Settings_**. The supporting web servers will also need the [client installed](../../../admin/client.php.md#install-url-only) to enable URL redirects. Once defined, the URL RR will be available when managing zone records.
