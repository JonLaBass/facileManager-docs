## General Usage
Instead of writing your own interface to the API, the associated module's `client.php` script can be used as an API client. You can use the client app on any existing client or you may install it on a system that will be used for API interaction without any other module functionality.

If you choose to use the API from a system that is not a module client, you still need to install the client scripts, but may enable the API functionality within the module `client.php` script:

`sudo php /usr/local/facileManager/fmDNS/client.php install api`
